The first history podcast almost everyone recommends for a reason. It's not for everyone, mostly because the episodes are usually three to five hours long and are part of a longer series of four to six episodes to tell a complete story. I think of it as semiformal audiobooks from a lover of history who helps explain context. And I love Dan Carlin's voice.
