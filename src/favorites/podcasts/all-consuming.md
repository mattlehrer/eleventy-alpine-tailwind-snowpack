A show of two guys shooting the shit about new direct-to-consumer products that they mostly found from Instagram ads. Imagine a review of the Thigh Master if this was the 90s. Funny and sometimes the products are worth buying. (I bought the [Ember mug](https://ember.com/products/ember-mug-2) they recommended for my wife as a postpartum gift because moms are too used to cold coffee. Success.)
